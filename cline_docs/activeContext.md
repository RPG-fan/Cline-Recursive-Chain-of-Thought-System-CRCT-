# Active Context:

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the CRCT submodule project. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and team alignment.

**Use Guidelines:**
- **Current Work Focus:**  List the 2-3 *most critical* tasks currently being actively worked on. Keep descriptions concise and action-oriented.
- **Next Steps:**  List the immediate next steps required to advance the project. Prioritize and order these steps for clarity.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered or actively debated. Capture the essence of the decision and any open questions.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans (these belong in other memory bank files like `progress.md` or dedicated documentation).
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the *current* state of the project. Regularly review and prune outdated information.

## Current Work Focus:

- Implementing GitOps integration for submodules to ensure automatic Git operations during task execution.

## Next Steps:

1. Test the GitOps integration with a sample task execution.
2. Update the execution plugin to explicitly check for and use the GitOps integration.
3. Document the GitOps integration in the system manifest.
4. Consider adding similar integration for other plugins (strategy, cleanup/consolidation).

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- **GitOps Integration:** Created `gitops_integration.md` and added `[GITOPS_REMINDER]` section to `.clinerules` to ensure automatic GitOps workflow integration when using the CRCT system as a submodule.
- **Reminder System:** Implemented a reminder system to ensure GitOps operations are performed at the beginning and end of task execution.
- **Documentation:** Consider whether additional documentation or examples are needed to clarify the GitOps integration process.
